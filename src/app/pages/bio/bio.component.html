        yowdie is the lo-fi alias of Jordan Tanner — a musician, producer, and ex-touring guitarist hailing from Austin, Texas now based in Charlotte.

        After years spent coding by day and producing tracks by night, he returns with a sound that blends dusty hip-hop drums, analog textures, and late-night synths.

        Tanner's musical roots trace back to touring with alt-rock outfit The Working Title, opening for acts like The Fray and Counting Crows. He later released two solo records, including the Cold City EP produced by Rick Beato. Then he vanished from the music scene — until now.

        As yowdie, he builds quiet anthems for insomniacs and romantics, full of melancholic loops and noir moods. Music for city windows, thunderclouds, and whatever happens after midnight.
